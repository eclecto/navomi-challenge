### Full Stack Engineer Coding Exercise: Movie App

* This application uses Node, NPM, and Yarn
* Use `yarn run yarn-install` to install all modules both for the Express server and the React client.
* Use `yarn run dev` to compile all code and concurrently launch the server and the client.
* **Known issue:** The client sometimes starts before the server, resulting in an error. Refresh the screen.
* The React client uses an editable table to add, update, and delete movies from the database.
* The client and server both validate input, so a custom REST request should behave as expected.
