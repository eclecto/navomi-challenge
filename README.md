### Full Stack Engineer Coding Exercise: Movie App

#### Installation
* This application uses Node, NPM, and Yarn
* Use `yarn run yarn-install` to install all modules both for the Express server and the React client.
* Use `yarn run dev` to compile all code and concurrently launch the server and the client.
* A browser window should launch automatically, otherwise you can navigate to the frontend interface at https://localhost:3000
#### Security
* This app uses a self-signed SSL certificate for HTTPS, and as a result most browsers will prompts you to proceed.
* All database calls except user registration and signin require a JWT cookie generated by logging in.
* There is a dummy user already in the system, username `eric` and password `abcdefG1`.
* Password requirement is minimum 8 characters, including capital and lowercase letters and a number.
* 
* If you are logged out, you will be redirected to https://localhost:3000/login
* The React client uses an editable table to add, update, and delete movies from the database.
* The client and server both validate input, so a custom REST request should behave as expected.
